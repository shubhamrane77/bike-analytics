Bike Data Analytics Dashboard created using Excel. This project involves data cleaning, analysis, and visualization of customer demographics and bike purchasing trends.
## Project Overview
This project presents a **Bike Data Analytics Dashboard** created using **Excel**. It provides interactive visualizations of customer demographics and bike purchasing trends. The dashboard helps analyze key factors like income, age, commute distance, and more, which influence bike purchasing decisions.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Initial dataset was cleaned to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Interactive Filters**: Users can explore data through various filters (e.g., marital status, region, education, gender, and occupation).
- **Charts and Visualizations**:
  - Average income per bike purchase segmented by gender.
  - Customer age bracket and the count of purchased bikes.
  - Commute distance vs. the number of bikes purchased.
  - Distribution of bike purchases by specific age brackets.
  
## Dashboard Visualizations
The dashboard includes:
1. **Average Income Per Purchase**: Displays the relationship between average income and bike purchasing habits by gender.
2. **Customer Age Bracket**: Visualizes the number of bikes purchased across different age groups.
3. **Customer Commute**: Shows bike purchasing trends based on customers' commute distances.
4. **Age Distribution**: Detailed analysis of bike purchases segmented by specific age groups.
  
Each visualization offers a detailed breakdown, allowing insights into how various demographics impact bike purchasing behavior.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation.
- **PivotTables and Charts**: To generate interactive visualizations.
- **Slicers and Filters**: For dynamic data exploration across different variables.

## Data Cleaning Process
- Removed missing or irrelevant entries.
- Formatted data for consistency (e.g., date, currency, and text normalization).
- Handled outliers and null values for more accurate trend analysis.

## How to Use
1. Download the Excel file from the repository.
2. Open the file and explore the interactive dashboard.
3. Use the slicers on the left-hand side to filter the data based on:
   - Marital status
   - Region
   - Education level
   - Gender
   - Occupation
4. Analyze the charts for insights into bike purchasing patterns.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate predictive analytics to forecast future bike purchasing trends.
- Integrate additional datasets for deeper demographic analysis.
